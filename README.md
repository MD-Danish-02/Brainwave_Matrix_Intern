# 🚧 Challenges Faced & Solutions
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation
Challenge: The dataset contained missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent formatting.
Solution: Applied Power BI’s data transformation tools (Power Query) to clean, format, and standardize the data before visualization.

2️⃣ Performance Optimization
Challenge: Large dataset size led to slow dashboard performance.
Solution: Used data aggregation, optimized DAX queries, and minimized unnecessary calculations to improve loading speed.

3️⃣ Effective Data Visualization
Challenge: Choosing the right charts and visuals to communicate insights clearly.
Solution: Used a mix of pie charts, bar graphs, and maps to represent different types of data while maintaining a user-friendly layout.

4️⃣ Handling Dynamic Data Updates
Challenge: Data needed to be updated frequently without breaking visuals.
Solution: Implemented data refresh automation in Power BI to ensure real-time insights.

5️⃣ Dashboard Responsiveness
Challenge: Ensuring the dashboard was interactive and easy to navigate.
Solution: Used slicers, filters, and drill-through features to improve usability and user experience.
